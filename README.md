# Friend-Finder

In this activity, we built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from a survey. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

A fullstack application using the Express package for Node.js!

This app uses Express to serve 2 static HTML files and 2 API routes to get and post data.

Note that data is not persistent, but rather stored in an object in friends.js for your current session.

Check out the deployed app on Heroku: https://limitless-earth-37549.herokuapp.com/
